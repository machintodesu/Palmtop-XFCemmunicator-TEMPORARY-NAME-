# Palmtop-XFCemmunicator-TEMPORARY-NAME-
A cassette-futurism inspired Linux handheld built around the Pixel 3a XL and Rii i4 keyboard. 
The XFCemmunicator is an attempt to exit the mobile paradigm of oversimplification of interface and input as well as offer an alternative to Android as Google pushed to restrict sideloading.

Disclaimer: 
This was designed around the Pixel 3a XL since it presents broad support for linux distros while being cheep and widely available. Every nonlinux-first phone comes with compromises, in this case the most glaring limitations are the lack of USB host drivers, and usable camera drivers in the Linux kernel. Some distros like UBports and Droidian use the Android kernel to get around these limitations, but trap the user in Lomiri and Phosh respectively due to compatibility layers. If you want the ability to install alternate desktop environments like XFCE, I recommend either Mobian or PostmarketOS.
